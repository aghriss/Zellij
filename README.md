* Zellij (Moroccan tiles)  - KDE Plasma Tiling Manager

This is a simple tiling Kwin script for KDE Plasma.

The shortcuts are self-explanatory. These are my settings:

| Move Down              | Meta+Down             |
| Move Left              | Meta+Left             |
| Move Right             | Meta+Right            |
| Move Up                | Meta+Up               |
